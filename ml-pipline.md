Problem definiton
Data preparation
    1. Data sourcing
    2. Data preparation 
        2.1 Data analysis
        2.2 Data scaling
        Handling features - choosing optimal feature:
            feature enginering
            feature scaling
            feature selection 

    3. Data segragation: 
        3.1 Train/Test split - Pareto Principle           
        3.2 K-Fold Cross Validation
Model Training
Model Evaluation
    Regression Modesl Evaluation metrics:
        1. Max Error
        2. Mean Absolute Error
        3. Mean Squared Error
        4. R Square - ( eq Correlation ^ 2) tells us how much percentage of the data is explained by the relationship but no direction 
        Additionally to Spot-Check Algorithms we can improve ml model performance by using:         
           - Ensemble methods: bagging, boosting, voting
           - hyperparameter optymization
