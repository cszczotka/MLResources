ML algorithm types:

## Supervised Learning Algorithms
### Regresion 
For continues values
### Clasification
For discrete (categorical) values

## Linear Learner and XGBoost
if you want to solve a problem whose answers fit into discrete categories or that are quantitative, you can use the Linear Learner and XGBoost algorithms, 

## Factorization Machines
if the problem you want to tackle has answers that are discrete recommendations, the Factorization Machines algorithm could be a nice choice. 

## K-Means
if you want to identify groups in a set of observations, you may use the K-Means algorithm 

## Principal Component Analysis
if you want to simply fight and better understand attributes of observations, the Principal Component Analysis algorithm may be the right tool for the job. 

## Image Classification
if you want to classify images into categories, as we're going to do for our Breast Cancer Detection API, you can use the Image Classification algorithm. 


For doing things like neural machine translation, for example 


if you want to translate text from English to Spanish, you can apply the Sequence-to-Sequence algorithm. 

If you want to determine topics in a set of documents, you can choose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm or Neural Topic Model algorithm if you want to use neural networks for of the same task.
