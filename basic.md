# Univariant Numerical Analysis

## Mean
** Mean = Sum of Values / Number of Values
Mean is sensitive for extreme values
## Median
** Median is the value separating lower half from the upper half of the data
## Percentiles
** Percentiles is a measure used indicating certain percentage of the dataset is below that value
## Standard Deviation
** Standard deviation is measure that tells the typical difference between the a data value and the mean
## Maximum and Minimum
## Count

## Mode 
** Most frequent value in the dataset
## Range
** Range = Max Value - Min Value
## Outliers
** Outliers = ( larger than mean + 2 * standard deviation)



# Bivariant Numerical Analysis    

## Correlation
** Correlation is a measure defining to what extent two or more varaibles are linearly related
** Positive Correlation 
** Negative Correlation - incrate one variable dicresse second
** No Correleation 
** The Correlation Fallacy

# K-Fold Cross Validation
Testing and training technics
Split the dataset to K groups (folds)
Choose one group as a test set and the other as training set
Train and calculate the accuracy
Choose next group as a test set and reapat
Calculate average accuracy from all training rounds
